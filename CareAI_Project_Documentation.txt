## 1. Project Overview
CareAI is an intelligent, empathetic AI assistant system designed to handle social service interactions. It provides a conversational interface for users to interact with various services, get information, and perform tasks using natural language. The system leverages modern AI technologies, particularly large language models, to understand and respond to user queries in a human-like manner.

## 2. System Architecture

The system follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

### 2.1 Layers
- **API Layer (CareAI.API)**: Handles HTTP requests, authentication, and API documentation
- **Application Layer (CareAI.Services)**: Contains business logic and service implementations
- **Domain Layer (CareAI.Core)**: Defines domain models, interfaces, and core business rules
- **Infrastructure Layer (CareAI.Infrastructure)**: Manages data access and external service integrations

### 2.2 Key Components
- **Conversation Engine**: Manages multi-turn conversations with users
- **Service Integration**: Handles integration with external services and APIs
- **Knowledge Base**: Stores and retrieves information for the AI to reference
- **User Management**: Handles user authentication and profile management
- **Analytics**: Tracks usage patterns and system performance

## 3. Technical Stack

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Conversational Interface
- Natural language understanding and generation
- Context-aware responses
- Multi-turn conversation support
- Sentiment analysis

### 4.2 Service Integration
- Appointment scheduling
- Service discovery and recommendation
- Form filling assistance
- Document processing

### 4.3 User Management
- Secure authentication and authorization
- User profiles and preferences
- Conversation history
- Role-based access control

### 4.4 Admin Dashboard
- User management
- Conversation monitoring
- Analytics and reporting
- System configuration

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Database Design
- **Users**: Stores user information and credentials
- **Conversations**: Tracks conversation history and context
- **Messages**: Stores individual messages within conversations
- **ServiceRequests**: Manages service-related requests and their status
- **KnowledgeBase**: Stores reference information for the AI

### 5.2 API Endpoints
- `POST /api/conversation/start`: Start a new conversation
- `POST /api/conversation/{conversationId}/message`: Send a message in a conversation
- `GET /api/conversation/{conversationId}`: Get conversation history
- `POST /api/services/recommend`: Get service recommendations
- `POST /api/services/process`: Process a service request

### 5.3 AI Integration
The system integrates with Azure OpenAI Service to power its conversational capabilities:
- Uses GPT-4 for natural language understanding and generation
- Implements prompt engineering for consistent responses
- Handles conversation state management
- Implements safety filters and content moderation

## 6. Challenges Faced

### 6.1 Technical Challenges
1. **Conversation Context Management**:
   - Challenge: Maintaining context across multiple turns of conversation
   - Solution: Implemented a sliding window approach to manage conversation history

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Challenge: High latency in AI model responses
   - Solution: Implemented response caching and optimized prompt engineering

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Challenge: Gracefully handling AI service failures
   - Solution: Implemented retry policies and fallback responses

4. **Security**:
   - Challenge: Protecting sensitive user data
   - Solution: Implemented data encryption and strict access controls

### 6.2 Project Management Challenges
1. **Feature Prioritization**:
   - Challenge: Managing stakeholder expectations with limited resources
   - Solution: Implemented agile methodology with clear sprint goals

2. **Technical Debt**:
   - Challenge: Accumulation of quick fixes
   - Solution: Scheduled refactoring sprints and code reviews

## 7. Getting Started

### 7.1 Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- SQL Server 2022 or later
- Redis 6.0 or later
- Azure account (for OpenAI service)

### 7.2 Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Update connection strings in `appsettings.json`
3. Configure Azure OpenAI credentials
4. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   cd src/CareAI.API
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/CareAI.API
   ```

## 8. API Documentation

### 8.1 Authentication
All API endpoints (except `/api/auth/*`) require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header:
```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

### 8.2 Endpoints

#### Start a New Conversation
```
POST /api/conversation/start
```
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "initialMessage": "Hello, I need help with something"
}
```

#### Send a Message
```
POST /api/conversation/{conversationId}/message
```
**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "message": "What services do you offer?"
}
```
